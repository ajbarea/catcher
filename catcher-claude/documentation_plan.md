# Catcher Game - Documentation Plan

## Game Objectives
- Create an engaging falling object catching game using Pygame
- Provide smooth mouse and keyboard controls for horizontal movement
- Implement a scoring system that rewards successful catches
- Design intuitive gameplay that's easy to learn but challenging to master

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **Game Engine** (`catcher.py`)
   - Main game loop and state management
   - Event handling (mouse, keyboard, quit)
   - Display rendering and updates

2. **Player System** (`player.py`)
   - Catcher sprite with horizontal movement
   - Input handling (mouse position, A/D keys)
   - Collision detection with falling objects

3. **Object System** (`objects.py`)
   - Falling object generation and management
   - Random spawn timing and positions
   - Object physics (gravity, speed variations)

4. **Scoring System** (`score.py`)
   - Point calculation and tracking
   - Score display and persistence
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, streaks)

5. **Graphics Assets**
   - Catcher sprite (basket/net design)
   - Falling objects (fruits, gems, coins)
   - Background and UI elements
   - Particle effects for catches
