# Catcher Game: Documentation Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Catcher game, a simple interactive game built with Pygame.

## 1. Game Objectives

The primary objective of the Catcher game is to control a "catcher" character at the bottom of the screen to catch objects that fall from the top. The player's score increases with each successfully caught object. The game is designed to be a fun, simple, and engaging experience that tests the player's reflexes.

## 2. Architecture

The game will be developed using Python and the Pygame library. The architecture is designed to be simple and modular, allowing for easy understanding and potential future expansion.

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Library:** Pygame
- **Core Components:**
    - **`main.py`:** The main entry point of the application. It will contain the primary game loop, handle game state transitions, and manage the overall flow of the game.
    - **Player Class:** A class to represent the player's catcher. It will manage the catcher's position, movement, and appearance.
    - **FallingObject Class:** A class for the objects that fall from the top of the screen. It will handle their position, speed, and appearance.
    - **Scoring System:** A simple counter to track the number of objects caught by the player.
    - **Input Handling:** A module to process input from the mouse and keyboard (A/D keys) to control the player's catcher.
    - **Rendering:** The game will be rendered in a simple 2D view.

## 3. Key Milestones

The development of the Catcher game will be broken down into the following milestones:

1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize the project structure, including creating the necessary files (`main.py`, `README.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`).
2.  **Basic Game Window:** Create a basic Pygame window that can be closed by the user.
3.  **Player Implementation:**
    - Create the `Player` class.
    - Implement player movement based on mouse input.
    - Implement player movement based on keyboard input (A and D keys).
4.  **Falling Objects Implementation:**
    - Create the `FallingObject` class.
    - Implement the logic for objects to fall from the top of the screen at random horizontal positions.
5.  **Collision Detection:** Implement the logic to detect when the player's catcher collides with a falling object.
6.  **Scoring and UI:**
    - Implement a scoring system that increments when an object is caught.
    - Display the current score on the screen.
7.  **Game Loop Refinement:** Refine the game loop to ensure smooth gameplay, including object respawning and increasing difficulty (optional).
8.  **Finalization and Documentation:**
    - Write the final user guide (`README.md`).
    - Review and clean up the code.
    - Ensure the game is runnable and meets all initial requirements.
