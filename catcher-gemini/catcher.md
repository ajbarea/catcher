# Catcher: An interactice PyGame

I want you to build a new Pygame project called Catcher. The player controls a catcher at the bottom of the screen—moving it horizontally with the mouse and/or A and D keys—to catch objects falling from the top. Each caught object earns points.  

Please deliver:  
1. A documentation plan outlining game objectives, architecture, and key milestones.  
2. A user guide with controls, scoring, and gameplay instructions.  
3. A complete, runnable Pygame app that implements "Catcher" with graphics, input handling, scoring, and game loop.
